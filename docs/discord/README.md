# Generate Discord Token

This section deals with generating of what's called a Discord token. A token essentially is a long string of letters and is another way of gaining access to Discord besides the usual method of a username password pair. 
<br />
Although there are ways to generate a token for your own Discord account, for this excercise however, we would instead create a bot token or a token that belongs to a **Bot**. 
<br />
<br />
*Why should we need to use a bot account and not our own?*
> Well, it's generally bad practice as per Discord and may even lead to account deactivation if used excessively. Not to mention it could also compromise your account if you accidently expose it somewhere. 
<br />
<br />
With a bot account however, the element of risk is low as you can limit a bot's access to only a certain number of servers or channels. Discord also recommends using a bot account for any activity that's automated.


## Building the Bot
To get a Bot token we need to, well add a Bot, right?
1. The first step is log into to [Discord](https://discordapp.com) and head over to the [Applications](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) page.
<br />

2. Tap on the **New Application** button to register a new application.

3. In the dialog give it a name you like. If you're unsure just type *Textcord* and hit **Create**.
<br />

<br />

4. Tap on the application tile you just created, find the **Bot** section in the left hand **Settings** pane and tap on it. 
<br />

<br />

5. Tap on the **Add Bot** button and confirm your action in the dialog that follows.

6. You've just created a Bot! ðŸŽ‰ Now is the time to get creative and choose a name for this Bot. 
<br /> *This is the name the people will in channels when you post a text using SMS so make sure this sounds dope. You can also change your bot's profile picture from here.*

## Adding the Bot To Your Servers
Since our super dope bot is ready we can now add it to one or more Discord servers.

1. On the same screen, tap on the <b>OAuth2</b> section in the left hand **Settings** pane. 

2. Scroll down to the <b>Scopes</b> section and check the <b>"bot"</b>option. 

3. After checking the bot option, the <b>Bot Permissions</b> section will appear. In this section you need to enable a few checkboxes. This is shown in the image below.
